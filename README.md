# RememberMe
This is a program that helps the user to memorize large amounts of information. This program uses the Ebbinghaus Forgetting curve Hypothesis. According to this theory,
repetition of information at regular intervals can increase memorization efficiency by 8-9 times. Ebbinghaus recommends the following intervals:
Repetition 0 - learning.
1st repetition - immediately after learning.
2nd repetition - 10-20 minutes after the first.
3rd repetition - 8-12 hours after the second.
4th repetition - 24-32 hours after the third.
5th repetition - 3-5 days after the fourth and so on.
Thus, this program is mostly a reminder and an accounting tool for all learned information and repetitions.

Intended users: students, teachers, foreign languages learners, and, in general, everyone who prepares for tests and exams.
